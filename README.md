# Simple-HTTP-Proxy

Simple-HTTP-Proxy is the proxy programming excercise in the book ***Computer Architecture: A Programer's Perspective***.

It is a simple multi-threaded HTTP proxy that runs on Linux.

It can handle multiple HTTP-GET requests concurrently by creating a new thread to serve each incoming request. A simple cache has been implemented in the proxy.
